# Deep-Learning3-ANN-classification
A simple feedforward neural network (FNN) using Keras for image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, with the ability to test on real-world images.
Features
Loads and normalizes the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
Implements a feedforward neural network with:
Flatten layer to convert 28×28 images to 784 features.
One hidden Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
Output Dense layer for 10 classes.
Trains the model for 10 epochs.
Predicts labels on test data and visualizes results.
Supports testing on real images (e.g., boot2.png).
Libraries
TensorFlow / Keras
Matplotlib
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
keras_visualizer for model visualization
